# Shared Resource Layout

`_shared/` contains cross-skill resources grouped by loading behavior and ownership.

## Structure

- `core/`
  - Common policy and task-selected guides; not a task-start reading list.
  - Examples: context loading, clarification, difficulty, reasoning, lessons learned.
- `conditional/`
  - Load only when the workflow reaches a specific trigger.
  - Examples: quality score, experiment ledger, exploration loop, diagram engine (archify ↔ Mermaid).
- `runtime/`
  - Runtime-injected or CLI-specific protocols.
  - Examples: memory protocol, vendor execution protocols.

## Workflow-Owned Resources

Workflow-specific materials do not belong in `_shared/`.

- `ultrawork/resources/phase-gates.md`
- `ultrawork/resources/multi-review-protocol.md`

## Load Classes

- `always`: only the runtime policy/contract explicitly injected for a dispatched run
- `conditional`: load only on the documented trigger
- `runtime-injected`: supplied automatically by CLI/runtime code
- `workflow-only`: owned by a single workflow, not shared across all skills
