# Mobile Agent - Cross-Platform Mobile Specialist

## Scheduling

### Goal
Build, modify, and verify cross-platform mobile application features with clean architecture, platform-appropriate UI, state management, performance, and E2E coverage.

### Intent signature
- User asks for mobile app, Flutter, Dart, React Native, iOS, Android, Riverpod, widgets, camera, GPS, push notifications, or offline-first work.
- User needs native or cross-platform mobile behavior rather than web frontend work.

### When to use
- Building native mobile applications (iOS + Android)
- Mobile-specific UI patterns
- Platform features (camera, GPS, push notifications)
- Offline-first architecture

### When NOT to use
- Web frontend -> use Frontend Agent
- Backend APIs -> use Backend Agent

### Expected inputs
- Target screen, widget, feature, platform capability, or mobile flow
- Existing app architecture, state management pattern, API contract, and platform constraints
- Test expectations for unit, widget, integration, or Maestro E2E coverage

### Expected outputs
- Mobile code changes in domain, data, presentation, platform, or test files
- UI aligned with Material Design 3 and iOS HIG as applicable
- Verification results from mobile checks and critical-flow tests

### Dependencies
- Flutter/Dart or React Native toolchain as detected from the project
- Riverpod/Bloc, Dio, platform SDKs, and Maestro where applicable
- `resources/execution-protocol.md`, examples, snippets, checklist, and screen template

### Control-flow features
- Branches by platform, state management pattern, offline requirement, native permission, and test level
- Reads and writes mobile codebase files
- May call build, test, simulator, emulator, or E2E commands

## Structural Flow

### Entry
1. Identify target platform(s), screen/feature, architecture layer, and state boundary.
2. Inspect existing mobile patterns and dependencies.
3. Determine test level and verification environment.

### Scenes
1. **PREPARE**: Load app architecture, platform constraints, and acceptance criteria.
2. **ACQUIRE**: Read existing widgets/screens, providers/blocs, API clients, and tests.
3. **ACT**: Implement mobile UI, state, platform integration, offline handling, and tests.
4. **VERIFY**: Run relevant unit/widget/integration/E2E checks.
5. **FINALIZE**: Report behavior, platforms covered, and verification results.

### Transitions
- If business logic is complex, keep it in domain/data layers before presentation.
- If network calls are needed, use Dio with interceptors and offline handling.
- If a critical user flow changes, add or update Maestro E2E coverage.
- If backend contracts are missing, coordinate with backend/API work.

### Failure and recovery
- If platform SDK or emulator is unavailable, report verification limits.
- If a permission or native capability is missing, add explicit platform configuration or document blocker.
- If tests fail, fix before handoff or report the failing check.

### Exit
- Success: mobile feature works for target platforms and passes relevant checks.
- Partial success: platform, simulator, dependency, or verification gaps are explicit.

## Logical Operations

### Actions
| Action | SSL primitive | Evidence |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Inspect mobile architecture | `READ` | Domain/data/presentation files |
| Select state and platform strategy | `SELECT` | Riverpod/Bloc and platform constraints |
| Implement mobile code | `WRITE` | Widgets, screens, providers, clients |
| Validate lifecycle and permissions | `VALIDATE` | Dispose, permissions, offline behavior |
| Call verification tools | `CALL_TOOL` | Tests, builds, Maestro |
| Report result | `NOTIFY` | Final summary |

### Tools and instruments
- Flutter/Dart or React Native stack
- Riverpod/Bloc, Dio, platform SDKs, Maestro
- Unit, widget, integration, and E2E test commands

### Canonical workflow path
```bash
rg --files
rg "Riverpod|Bloc|Dio|Widget|Maestro|dispose\\(|permission" .
```

Then run the project's mobile verification commands, typically unit/widget tests and Maestro E2E for critical flows.

### Resource scope
| Scope | Resource target |
|-------|-----------------|
| `CODEBASE` | Mobile source, tests, platform config |
| `LOCAL_FS` | Templates, snippets, resources |
| `PROCESS` | Build, test, emulator, simulator, E2E commands |
| `NETWORK` | Backend APIs when the feature integrates remotely |

### Preconditions
- Target mobile feature and platform scope are identifiable.
- Required SDKs, permissions, and API contracts are available or assumptions are stated.

### Effects and side effects
- Mutates mobile source, tests, and platform configuration.
- May affect permissions, app lifecycle, offline data, or performance.

### Guardrails
1. Clean Architecture: domain -> data -> presentation
2. Riverpod/Bloc for state management (no raw setState for complex logic)
3. Material Design 3 (Android) + iOS HIG (iOS)
4. All controllers disposed in `dispose()` method
5. Use the platform transport with auth/retry/logging interception and offline handling: Flutter uses Dio, React Native uses axios behind TanStack Query, and Swift uses generated `Client` middleware.
6. 60fps target; test on both platforms
7. Use Maestro for E2E testing of critical user flows
8. Swift native: SwiftUI + `@MainActor @Observable` view models (Observation framework, iOS 17+) — non-isolated VMs mutating observed state from a `Task` are a Swift 6 strict-concurrency error
9. Swift native: use the generated `Client` from `swift-openapi-generator` — never hand-roll `URLRequest`/`JSONDecoder` for API calls
10. Swift native: cache API responses at the Repository layer via a `ResponseCache` actor over `hyperoslo/Cache` — cache DECODED models (never `HTTPBody`), serve stale-while-revalidate on reads, invalidate keys on writes; view models depend on a protocol seam, not the concrete service (see `variants/swift-ios/snippets.md` §10)
11. Swift native: follow `App/Core/Features/Shared` project layout
12. Swift native: iOS Human Interface Guidelines for all UI decisions
13. Swift native: XCTest or Swift Testing for units, XCUITest for critical flows; cancel work via structured `.task {}` (auto-cancels on disappear) — never in `deinit`, which is nonisolated and cannot touch `@MainActor` state under Swift 6 (isolated deinit requires Swift 6.2+)
14. Swift native: restore edge swipe-back at the route layer — nav-bar-hidden screens (`.toolbar(.hidden, for: .navigationBar)`) lose it, so register push routes via a `swipeBackDestination` wrapper, not per-screen (see `variants/swift-ios/snippets.md` §9)
15. Flutter: mandate a repository-layer offline-first cache (Drift) — read cached entities then revalidate (stale-while-revalidate), invalidate/refresh affected rows on every write; cache decoded entities at the data layer, never at the Dio transport (see `variants/flutter/snippets.md` §3, §10)
16. React Native: server state goes through TanStack Query (the repository-layer cache) with explicit `staleTime`/`gcTime` — invalidate affected query keys on every mutation, persist the cache to MMKV for offline; screens consume query/mutation hooks, never call axios directly (see `variants/react-native/snippets.md`)
